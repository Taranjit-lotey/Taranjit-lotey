## Hi there 👋

# 💫 About Me:
I'm a Data Engineer who believes good data work starts with understanding the problem, not the tools. Before I write any code, I ask what decision this data will drive and who will be affected by it will affect. That context shapes everything — from how I design the architecture to how I document it for whoever maintains it next. I care about building pipelines that are scalable, reliable, and actually make sense to someone reading them six months later. On the technical side, I'm comfortable owning systems end-to-end: ingestion, transformation, orchestration, monitoring, and the inevitable 2am incident. On the non-technical side, I know how to translate between engineers and stakeholders who just want their dashboard to work. I build side projects not because I have to, but because I'm genuinely curious about how things work under the hood. I thrive with ownership and autonomy, but I also value teams where people teach each other, ask dumb questions, and leave things better than they found them. Figuring things out is the part I enjoy most.
